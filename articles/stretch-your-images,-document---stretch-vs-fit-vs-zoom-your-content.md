# Stretch your images, document - Stretch vs Fit vs Zoom your content

In general, we recommend you to upload images, document that will fit the size
of your screens.  
Most likely your big screens TV will have resolution of: 1920 x 1080 pixels
(Full HD) or 3840 x 2160 pixels (4K).

However, if you upload an image or document that is smaller than your screen's
resolution. You can select to Fit or Stretch or Zoom it so that it can fill
the screen.

If you only have 1 asset and want to apply the Stretch, Fit, Zoom feature to
an Asset or Schedule, you can create a playlist and just put that asset in
there, set the Stretch, Fit, Zoom options and assign that playlist to your
screen or schedule.
