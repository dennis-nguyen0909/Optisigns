# How to setup WIFI with OptiSigns Admin mobile app on OptiSigns Pre-Configured Android Player

In some cases, you may need to setup wifi on the OptiSigns pre-configured
android player. For example, you choose not to pre-configure wifi at the time
of ordering, or if you are planning to move the devices from one location to
another location with different wifi network.

Now you have the capability to setup wifi on OptiSigns pre-configured android
player using the OptiSigns admin mobile app. We will walk you through how to
do it in this document.

**1\. Optisigns app shows "Internet Connection is required for first time" on
the screen.**

You can download the OptiSigns admin app by scanning the QR code on the
screen. If you already have the OptiSigns admin app installed you can go to
