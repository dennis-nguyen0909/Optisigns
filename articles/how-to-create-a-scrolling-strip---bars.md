To achieve the screen layout like above, we first [create a Split Screen
layout](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026559573).  
Then create Scrolling Strip to assign to the bottom or top part of the split
screen.

To create a Scrolling Strip, first click Files/Assets -> Apps -> Scrolling
Strip

(Enter).

You then can assign the scrolling strip to your split screen zone.  
For your convenient, if you use one of our Split Screen Templates, we already
label Zone name with "Scrolling Strip" and you just need to assign the newly
create Scrolling Strip there.
