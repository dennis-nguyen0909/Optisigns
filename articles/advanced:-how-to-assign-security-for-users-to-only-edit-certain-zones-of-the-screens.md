This article will guide you through how to assign security for users to only
edit certain zones of the screens.  
Use Case: a Company with 2 departments, Department A and Department B, each
will have a section/zone of the screen that they can update freely, but they
cannot change the zone belong to other departments. Administrators can edit
modify the whole screen.

5) Set up security for Screens, Files/Assets, Playlist folders

For the screen: You can edit the "Change Permission" in the folder. You can
set **Admin Only**.

Put your screens in this folder so only Admins can edit & change assignment
for the screens.
